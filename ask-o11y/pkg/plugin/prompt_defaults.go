const DefaultInvestigationModeSystemAddendum = `## Alert investigation mode (this request)

The user started this turn from an alert notification. Prioritize **precision and fewer high-value tool calls** over exhaustive exploration.

- **Runbook ordering** — The user prompt requires checking the runbook_url annotation before deep investigation. Treat that as binding: fetch and apply the runbook before broad discovery.
- **Anchor on the alert** — Use the alert name, labels (namespace, cluster, service, job, severity), and any text in the notification to choose **narrow** filters. Do not run cluster-wide label enumeration when the alert already identifies a scope.
- **Tight parallel batches** — Parallel tool calls should share the same incident time window and suspected blast radius (e.g., alert row + metrics for the labeled job + logs for that service). Avoid parallel calls that scatter across unrelated systems without a hypothesis.
- **Sufficiency** — When metrics or logs support a likely root cause and you can name a single verification step, conclude. Do not continue investigating every datasource for completeness.
- **Final answer shape** — Lead with a **short verdict** (most likely cause), then evidence (queries, samples), then remediation and follow-up checks.`

const DefaultInvestigationPrompt = `Investigate the alert "{{.AlertName}}" and perform root cause analysis.

**Efficiency:** Treat this alert name and any labels on its rule or firing instance as the primary scope. Prefer **targeted** metrics and logs for the affected service or namespace over unfocused cluster-wide listing. Combine related queries where one PromQL or LogQL answers several checks.

**Your first step:** Find this alert by checking both:
1. Prometheus datasource alerts (list datasources once to get the Prometheus UID; reuse it)
2. Grafana-managed alerts

Once you find the alert, check its annotations for a runbook URL (commonly ` + "`runbook_url`" + `). If present, **fetch and read the runbook before** broader metrics/logs/trace exploration. Use the appropriate tool for the URL type (e.g., web_fetch for HTTP, confluence_get_page for Confluence). Follow the runbook's steps; use other tools to fill gaps it leaves open.

Then, scoped to the affected components and time of the incident:
1. Confirm current alert status and recent state changes
2. Query related metrics around the fire time (prefer label matchers from the alert)
3. Search error logs for the affected services (same window and scope)
4. Use traces only when they add signal for request-level failures or latency (same services)

**Conclude when:** You have a defensible primary hypothesis, supporting evidence, and remediation or escalation steps (aligned with the runbook if one was used).

**Final response:** Start with a brief **verdict**, then evidence, then remediation and one or two verification steps.

Use the available MCP tools for real data and actionable conclusions.`

const DefaultPerformancePrompt = `Analyze performance issues in the system "{{.Target}}".

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Query key performance metrics (CPU, memory, request latency, error rates)
2. Identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints
3. Search for error logs and warnings related to performance
4. Check for traces with high latency or failures
5. Correlate metrics, logs, and traces to identify root causes
6. Provide optimization recommendations

Use the available MCP tools to gather real data.`
